# Customer_Churn_Prediction
In this project, we will harness the power of machine learning algorithms to forecast customer churn. By employing advanced data analysis techniques, historical customer data will be examined and transformed into meaningful insights. These insights will be used to develop predictive models that can identify potential churn risks, enabling businesses to proactively retain customers. By anticipating churn, companies can implement targeted retention strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately drive sustainable growth and profitability, all based on the predictive capabilities of machine learning algorithms.


## What is customer churn?

Customer churn, often referred to as customer attrition, is the phenomenon where customers cease their relationship with a business or service, typically by discontinuing their subscriptions, canceling accounts, or no longer making purchases. It signifies a loss of revenue and necessitates efforts to retain or replace departing customers.
